Using the free version of the google translate API (see below), create a command line tool in Java to translate an arbitrary number of files from English to Swedish. (3 examples provided). The tool should take the names of the files as arguments. Although the example files are small, the solution should be able to handle arbitrarily large files.  All specified input files should be processed in parallel.  The results should be written to two separate text files output to the current directory. The first should be named AsYouGo.txt and have all results, one word per line, written as soon as they are processed. The second should be named Batched.txt and have one word per line in batches. Each batch should contain one translated result from each file, and sorted within the batch in alphabetical order. The batches should correspond to the original ordering in the files (i.e. the first batch would be a sorted list of the translations from the 1st line of each file, the second a sorted list from the 2nd line of each file, and so on).  Example:

Given the following files:

File1:
one
two
three

File2: 
four
five
six

File3:
seven
eight
nine

If the translations are:

File1:
en
tv책
tre

File2:
fyra
fem
sex

File3:
sju
책tta
nio

Then the batched result would be:

en
fyra
sju
fem
tv책
책tta
nio
sex
tre


Submission should include all necessary source and project files (including dependencies, if applicable) to build, test, and execute the solution.

Google translate URL: 
	
	https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=en&tl=sv&dt=t&q={toTranslate}

Notes on the API: 
- The URL already includes the parameters for English to Swedish
- It will temporarily block usage if it is used too much so test carefully. 
- It is legitimate for the translation to return the original word in cases where it's not found. In those cases the original should be used in the output.
